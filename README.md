# 🏃‍♂️ Run Clubs Estonia

A web app for discovering running clubs across Estonia. Built to help runners find their community, whether training for a 5K or looking for weekly running buddies. This project is a work in progress and will be developed further in the future.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project started as a personal initiative to solve a real problem: finding local running clubs in Estonia wasn't easy. I wanted to create a centralized, user-friendly platform where runners could quickly discover clubs by city, search by name, and see which clubs are running today. Right now all these running clubs are on different platforms and are tough to find. 

I handled everything from concept to design, development, testing, and infrastructure. It was my first time implementing E2E tests into a fully automated CI/CD pipeline managed through Netlify and Github Actions.
